# weatherguess
Can a neural network guess the weather given temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed?

I'm attempting to find out with [keras](https://keras.io) on top of [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org) as a learning experience and an intro for me into machine learning. All with python 3.

`python3 main.py --help`
